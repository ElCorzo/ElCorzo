- 👋 Hi, I’m @ElCorzo
- 👀 I’m interested in building a Custom ROM for my smartphone.
- 🌱 I’m currently working as a Java developer. Mainly back-end (ReST/Json/XML) on WildFly (JSF/JPA) with Sybase/MySQL/Kafka. Also like MondoDB.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on compiling a Google-Free Android that respects your privacy.
- 📫 Just send me a mail.
